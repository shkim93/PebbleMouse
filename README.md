PebbleMouse
===========
This repo contains the code for the Pebble Mouse application. The aim is to use accelerometer data gathered from the Pebble to control the cursor on the screen. There are three major parts to the project: a Pebble application that transmits accelerometer data to a corresponding Android application, then the Android app sends the data to a server application on the computer. The connections are established using Bluetooth.
